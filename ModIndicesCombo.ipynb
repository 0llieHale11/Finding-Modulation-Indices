    "So, we have seen that the MCMC method is accurate but it takes a while because we are starting from quite a few poisitions. The BRUTE function is quicker but less accurate. I think that using one of the functions form the BRUTE method to quickly find a few good starting poisitions for the MCMC would get the best from both. We can also speed up the MCMC by considering less points and betas / props can probably be reduced without changing the accuracy much.\n",

# Finding modulation indices
Finding modulation indices requires considering the Rabi frequencies of each transition and the efficiency of the modulation. Considering the real energy levels and transitions of 137Ba+ is to be included.

# CCI simulations
These simulations are also currently for general states and need to incorporate information about the energy level structure of 137Ba+.
